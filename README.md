Installation

1. HTML Template

The HTML template is located in the "html" folder. Inside the index.html code you will find comments <!-- *** *** -->, 
where you can setup your page (including the countdown date, the twitter account, the progress bar, colors and etc.). 
Inside the html directory you will find the "php" directory. You have to open from there the "notify.php" file. Inside
that file you should replace "any.email@company.com" with the email address where notifications requests will be received.
Type your settings and upload everything from the html folder to your web server.

2. Word Press Theme

The Word Press Theme is located in "wordpress" folder. Inside the theme directory you will find the "php" folder.
You have to open from there the "notify.php" file. Inside that file you should replace "any.email@company.com" with
the email address where notifications requests will be received.
Go back to the "wordpress" folder, and copy your logo inside the 'img' folder.
Create 'zip' archive with the theme folder. To install it, you have to log on to your wordpress admin panel.
 After you login, go to the "Appearance" menu. From the "Themes" page, go to the "Install Theme" tab and click 
the "Upload" link. Browse the zip file located in the "underconstruction-wptheme" directory and click
